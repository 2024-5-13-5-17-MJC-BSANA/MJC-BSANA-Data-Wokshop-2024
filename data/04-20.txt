38,000 of us pledged what we could, ranging from $1 to $50,000, in order to raise $2,000,000 to rebuild a few black churches.
Thatâ€™s what wealth inequality looks like."

RT @BrittPettibone: @RollingStone Notre Dame is not just a buildingâ€”itâ€™s an 856-year-old Catholic Cathedral, built for God, inside which Christians adore Him. It can never be â€œoverburdened with meaningâ€. These architects can take their slimy ideas of redesign and flush them down the toilet.
